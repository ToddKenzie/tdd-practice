# What's in this repository

This repository is for various code katas I worked through, rather than create separate repositories for each


## Code Katas

### **FizzBuzzQix kata**

*	If the number is divisible by 3, write “Foo” instead of the number
*	If the number is divisible by 5, add “Bar”
*	If the number is divisible by 7, add “Qix”
*	For each digit 3, 5, 7, add “Foo”, “Bar”, “Qix” in the digits order.

*	Additional request : we must keep a trace of 0 in numbers, each 0 must be replace par char “ * “.


### **Roman Numerals**

*	The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: 
	*	1 --> I, 10 --> X, 7 --> VII
*	There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn’t tend to go any higher)


### **BabySitter**

*	This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night.  The rules are pretty straight forward:

*	The babysitter 
	*	starts no earlier than 5:00PM
	*	leaves no later than 4:00AM
	*	gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
	*	gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
	*	gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
	*	gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)

*Feature:*
As a babysitter, in order to get paid for 1 night of work, 
I want to calculate my nightly charge

### **Tennis**

1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “fifteen”, “thirty”, and “forty” respectively.
3. If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is “deuce”.
4. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is “advantage” for the player in the lead.
