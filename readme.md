# What's in this repository

This repository is for various code katas I worked through, rather than create separate repositories for each


## Code Katas

**FizzBuzzQix kata**

*	If the number is divisible by 3, write “Foo” instead of the number
*	If the number is divisible by 5, add “Bar”
*	If the number is divisible by 7, add “Qix”
*	For each digit 3, 5, 7, add “Foo”, “Bar”, “Qix” in the digits order.

*	Additional request : we must keep a trace of 0 in numbers, each 0 must be replace par char “ * “.


**Roman Numerals**

*	The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: 
	*	1 --> I, 10 --> X, 7 --> VII
*	There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn’t tend to go any higher)


**BabySitter**

*	This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night.  The rules are pretty straight forward:

*	The babysitter 
	*	starts no earlier than 5:00PM
	*	leaves no later than 4:00AM
	*	gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
	*	gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
	*	gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
	*	gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)

*Feature:*
As a babysitter, in order to get paid for 1 night of work, 
I want to calculate my nightly charge
